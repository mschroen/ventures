Welcome to Ventures!

If you already have "perl", "pdflatex" and a local web server, there is almost nothing to do.
Otherwise this file will guide you through the installation.
In both cases some minor changes have to added to the configurations.

----
Perl  
----
(No installation needed if your system already knows the "perl" command.)

The while thing runs with perl, so you need to have a perl interpreter on your system. On windows I recommend to install "Strawberry perl".
http://strawberryperl.com/
Once installed, your system path should know "perl", which is located in the "strawberry/perl/bin" directory.
Open the command line and install additional modules by typing
    cpan
    install File::Copy
    install CGI::Carp
Use "force install" if the first attempt does not work out well.

---------
Webserver  
---------
(No installation needed if you already have local web server.)

You need a running webserver to display ventures on the browser. I recommend to install "Apache" to a simple path like "C:/apache".
http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
Ventures should be located in its subdirectory "htdocs", ie. "apache/htdocs/ventures".
The Apache process should be running whenever you want to use ventures, so I recommend to put it into the system's autorun directory. If the Apache Monitor has problems, you can execute "apache/bin/httpd.exe" alternatively.
Open "config/httpd.conf" and make sure to change the following settings:
    <IfModule dir_module>
        DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.pl
    <IfModule mime_module>
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
    <Directory "c:/apache/htdocs">
        Options ... ExecCGI

When everything is set correctly, typing "localhost" in the browser should show something. Then, "localhost/ventures" should show the ventures interface. If not, make sure that all files in apache/htdocs/ventures have 0755 rights. You could set the rights by going to the "apache/htdocs" directory via command line and type "chmod -R 0777 ventures". The "chmod" is available through "cygwin", which you might need to download and path first.

---
TeX  
---
(No installation needed if your system already knows the "pdflatex" command.)

To create PDFs directly from ventures, you need to have "pdflatex" in the system path. I recommend to install the current version of "TeXLive", but any distribution will do. To make sure that all TeX packages are installed, open tex/test.tex with your TeX editor and compile it with pdflatex. You should be asked to install missing packages.

-------
MathJax
-------

To display TeX code in the web browser, install MathJax from http://www.mathjax.org/download/
Copy all files in a "mathjax" folder one level up from ventures, eg. to apache/htdocs/mathjax/
when ventures is in apache/htdocs/ventures/

-----
Fonts
-----

You can change the fonts of the web interface in config/webstyles.css
If you want to use my favourite fonts, go to mods/fonts/ and install them.
You can change the fonts of the tex files by inserting your individual tex commands in config/template.tex
They should overwrite the commands used in tex/preamble.tex
      
------------------
More custom Styles
------------------

Files in the directory config/ should not be overwritten during updates. So you should try to add your style sheets there in order to overwrite the default settings. Any other changes made for example in the tex/ files should be backed up before updating and it will be your job to merge them back.

------
Backup
------

In order back up your files regulary to a (remote) directory, you may use and adapt sync2y.bat to your needs. If you do not have "rsync", you need to install "cygwin" from the internet and add its "bin" path to the system path.

----------------------
Get Ventures or Update
----------------------

You can download the current version as a zip file from https://github.com/mschroen/ventures
Or use "git clone https://github.com/mschroen/ventures.git" in
apache/htdocs/ to initially create a fresh local repo.
Or "git pull" if you want to update your local git repository.

NOTE: If you downloaded ventures the first time, you might need to
"chmod -R 0777 *" the whole directory to give apache writing permissions.
Otherwise no files or folders can be creates in the web interface.
